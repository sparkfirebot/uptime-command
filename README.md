# Uptime Command
### An uptime command for Discord.js v12/v13

# Setup
The code is in the `uptime.js` file. 

Go to your main bots file and check (normally at the top) for `const ??? = new Client({
  intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES, Intents.FLAGS.DIRECT_MESSAGES, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_EMOJIS_AND_STICKERS, Intents.FLAGS.DIRECT_MESSAGES]
});`

Adjust the `bot` in `bot.uptime` to whatever you have for your client.
